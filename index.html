		<h2 id = "k1">Definition/Description of What Venture Capital Financing is About</h2>
		<h2 id = "kk1">_____________________</h2>
		<p id = "kkk1">Venture Capital is a source of funding where preexisting firms and/or individuals provide capital to small companies in their early stages that happen to be on the verge of emergence into the general marketplace.  In the majority of the times, these companies receiving venture capital tend to have experienced some sort of growth or are in the very least, predicted to eventually experience a type of growth. This growth may strictly be in terms of annual revenue or in terms of resources or employees. As a general rule, businesses that receive venture capital must eventually show some type of signs of profitability.</p>

		<h2 id = "k2">Characteristics and Mechanics of Venture Capital as a Financing Option</h2>
		<h2 id = "kk2">_____________________</h2>
		<p id = "kkk2">Venture capitals work with what we call "venture capitalists." Venture capitalists are the individuals who physically invest their own money into startups in exchange for big stakes in their equity. They hope that these startups will eventually become more successful and that they will reap financial benefits of having such big portions of equity in these potentially profitable emerging businesses. The truth about distributing venture capital is that it is very risky. There is high degree of uncertaintity as how the business will perform in the existing market. It is all up the analysis of the investor to figure out if the company will be profitable in the long-term or die out quickly. The reality is that the majority of investments made by venture capitalists result in failure and this is why investing should be done with caution and significant knowledge of risk management. As most people involved in businesses know, there are primarily two styles of making money... There is the long-term and low-risk approach (i.e. investing in existing public corporations on the stock market, etc.) where a return is guaranteed, although it may not be higher... Conversely, on the other hand, there is the short-term, high risk approach to riches which usually yields a much higher profit than investing for the long-term, and this is partly why investors get lured into short-term opportunities like startups... On the business side of things, when startups receive venture capital... It is quite the opposite of receiving a loan. When companies are loaned money, the one giving the money has the right to earn interest on the loan as well as get their investment amount back regardless of the successfulness of the business. This means that startups would have to eventually give the money back regardless of how well their business does in the market, and therefore there is a risk of debt financing posed to startup owners. That is where venture capital comes in. Venture capital is much different than issuing a loan as the one who gives the money to the business actually becomes a sort of shareholder rather than a creditor. The shareholder's progit depends upon whether the business they invest in becomes successful or not. Venture capitalists may earn a profit by selling their shares in a startup to another company or individual when its value becomes more significant. Venture capitalists must be very picky when deciding which business to give their money to... In fact, a Stanford University survey revealed that the ratio of companies that get invest in for companies that are considered is 1:100 which means that 1% of total startups on average are invested in. In order for a startup to receive venture capital, it has to prove that it will experience significant growth within the next couple of years. Venture capitalists understand that investments are not always liquid, so if they predict things to start going downhill, they may not be able to pull out of the venture when they please. Of course, it is for this reason the venture capitalists are encouraged to proceed with the known precautious methods. Something highly important to take note about is that venture capitalists are not usually allowed to throw capital into companies and sit back. They are expected to help with in an area of the emerging company such as marketting, so there is a responsibility factor too that comes with investing in startups. The goal of venture capitalists is to get the startup to reach a stage where the Initial Public Offerings on the stock market are of considerable value. In general, venture capitalists play a couple of roles in helping startups. They sometimes contribute a new idea to the venture as well as bring their own talent in, or even prior experiences from other pursuits. They also help in the startup phase itself since their investments are made so early on in the company's life. In the startup, venture capitalists seek to validate the company and make its reputation go up in the public eye. They also try to introduce a scalable business model or make adjustments to an existing business model in the venture to make it more scalable and prone to growth. They also help the business ramp-up by increasing production to meet product or service demands. There are other areas venture capitalists help in as well. These were just to name a few.</p>

		<h2 id = "k3">Advantages of Venture Capital as a Financing Option</h2>
		<h2 id = "kk3">_____________________</h2>
		<p id = "kkk3">There are many advantages of venture capital financing. Firstly, there is an opportunity for expansion that would not be made possible with bank loans as bank loans often of the times require collateral and a guarantee that the startup will repay the debt within a given timeframe. Venture capital prevents startups from having to go through this hassle and allows them to focus their full attention on the expansion of the new organization rather than the repayment of debts. Another great advantage is the guidance as well as expertise that venture capitalists bring to the table. Venture capitalists almost always have a degree of experience  with prior companies as well as startups. They can use their real world skills, knowledge, and expertise they have acquired to kickstart a startup into more advanced growth stages. They can also help in technical areas, marketing, and even in bringing and managing resources. In addition, another advantage of venture capital is that the venture capitalists can help new businesses network and gain access to more connections.  The reason they can do this is because they have been in the business community for an outstanding amount of time and therefore have developed a huge network of connections. Networking allows for growth as it can introduce potential suppliers and customers to the emerging business. Additionally, there is another advantage of venture capital which is that there is no obligation to pay back  the venture capital should the startup have to shut down for any reason. This is great as new businesses may avoid worrying about having to pay back loans and other debts. Startups may also find venture capital appealing as  venture capitalists as partners are generally trustworthy due to the regulatory measures put in place to monitor them. They are not likely to engage in illegal activities like money laundering. Lastly, one more advantage of seeking venture capital is that venture capitalists are highly accessible and can be found in a number of listings as well as directories. This abundance of venture capital firms may be a big time saver. </p>

		<h2 id = "k4">Disdvantages of Venture Capital as a Financing Option</h2>
		<h2 id = "kk4">_____________________</h2>
		<p id = "kkk4">While some of the advantages of venture capital as a financing option have been pointed out, the disadvantages must be considered as well. One of the major disadvantages of seeking venture capital is that venture capitalists will have a stake in the equity of the new organization. Legally, they are the owners of the startup. The original founder of the emerging startup organization will have to make sure that any decisions they make are validated by the venture capitalists themselves. Control over the company will be diluted in a sense. Another disadvantage of venture capital financing is that venture capitalists may want to liquidate their investments quickly in order to make a gain on the investment. If the nature of the startup potentially holds them back from doing this, this may result in real agreement problems down the line. In addition, another disadvantage is that the actual process of getting a venture capitalist to join the startup business is extremely long. This is because the startup owners must first present the business model to the venture capitalists and then have a face-to-face meeting with them in order to provide more details about the business to the venture capitalist. The venture capitalist then must cautiously analyze the details presented to them to come to a final conclusion. There is therefore a considerable amount of wait time if a startup wants to gain access to venture capital. Venture capitalists will take huge amounts of time to decide whether they want to go through making an investment or not because investments are often very risky. After the whole process, it is totally possible that venture capitalists will pull out of making the investment, and therefore a major amount of time would be wasted. Another problem associated with seeking venture capital is that it may be difficult to get venture capitalists to notice a new business as they are always getting overflowed with emails and phone calls. Again, this may waste time. Nextly, another disadvantage to consider is that venture capitalists might want to have an extremely high ROI (return on investment) within a relatively short time span ranging from possibly 3-5 years. If startups will not be able to provide this high ROI, then venture capital may not be a good financing method for them. Furthermore, another disadvantage of venture capital funding is that the capital may not be available all at once. The venture capitalist may want to provide the capital in fractions whenever the startup reaches a specific milestone. For some startups, this might be unexpected as they may have been expecting to receive the agreed upon capital all in one payment. Not having access to all of the capital at once can be a significant disadvantage depending on how much capital the startup needed at a given time. Lastly, one more disadvantage to consider is that seeking venture capital may cause a new organization to become undervalued if the venture capitalist forces it to list the company publicly at a cheaper price in order to sell off all their equity.</p>

		<h2 id = "k5">Where The Funding Can be Obtained</h2>
		<h2 id = "kk5">_____________________</h2>
		<p id = "kkk5">Up to this point, a lot of the mechanics of how venture capital works was given from the investor’s point of view. Now the question is, how does venture capital work in terms of an actual startup? How would a company go about obtaining this type of financing? That will be answered in this section hopefully. As it is known, startups cannot publicly offer equity in their companies, so they have to take other measures in order to get a hold of venture capital firms or individual private equity investors. Sometimes, startups may get referrals. For example, there are often trusted services or sources that investors rely on for information on where to invest their money. This means that if a startup company can get these sources to recommend their startup, they may be able to become visible to venture capital firms or individual investors who will invest money. Another way for startups to receive venture capital is by hosting investor conferences. In an investor conference, the company presents their venture to a bunch of investors directly. Investors who find the startup potentially successful may sign up to invest in the business. They may even take a slower approach and just exchange contact information with the startup, so they can make sure they know who they are entrusting their money to. In addition, there is a specific type of investor conference where investors are forced to decide whether they want to be in a company or not in a given timeframe of only ten minutes. The advantage of this type of investor conference is that the investor must decide quickly without hesitating. One more way for startup companies to seek venture capital is through online private business networks… These online networks are new to the venture capital industry and are giving startups access to other methods of seeking venture capital.</p>
